## Features

- **Play sounds in voice chats**: Works in any voice applications (e.g. Teamspeak, Mumble, Skype, Discord) as well as in games such as Dota2, CS:GO and PUBG.
- **Hotkeys**: You can set hotkeys for sound files to play them during game play.
- **Recording and editing sounds** Soundpad lets you record what you hear - the sounds that play on your PC. And with the built-in editor, you can quickly edit what you've recorded.
- **Volume normalization**: Are some sound files quiet while others are too loud? The Normalize function will equalize volume levels to match the volume of your voice.
- **Easy customization**: Soundpad extends the functionality of your default recording device - most often a microphone - without the need to install additional hardware.
- **Supported file types**: aac, flac, m4a, mp3, ogg, opus, wav, wma
